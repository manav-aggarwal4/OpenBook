## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env.local

# Configure your environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYGON_RPC_URL=your_polygon_rpc_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_MUMBAI_RPC_URL=your_mumbai_rpc_url
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key
PRIVATE_KEY=your_deployment_private_key
```

### 2. Dependencies Installation
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Verify installation
npm run build
```

### 3. Smart Contract Deployment

#### Local Development
```bash
# Start local Hardhat node
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contracts locally
npm run contracts:deploy:local
```

#### Mumbai Testnet
```bash
# Deploy to Mumbai testnet
npm run contracts:deploy:mumbai

# Verify contracts on Mumbai PolygonScan
npx hardhat verify --network polygonMumbai CONTRACT_ADDRESS [args]
```

#### Polygon Mainnet
```bash
# Deploy to Polygon mainnet
npm run contracts:deploy:polygon

# Verify contracts on PolygonScan
npx hardhat verify --network polygon CONTRACT_ADDRESS [args]
```

### 4. Update Frontend Configuration
After deployment, update your `.env.local` with contract addresses:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CAMPUS_VERIFICATION_ADDRESS=deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEXTBOOK_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENBOOK_TOKEN_ADDRESS=deployed_contract_address
```

## üîß Configuration

### Frontend Configuration
```typescript
// src/lib/web3.ts
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  campusVerification: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CAMPUS_VERIFICATION_ADDRESS,
  textbookMarketplace: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TEXTBOOK_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS,
  openBookToken: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENBOOK_TOKEN_ADDRESS
}
```

### Network Configuration
```typescript
export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  chainId: 137, // Polygon mainnet
  chainName: 'Polygon',
  rpcUrl: 'https://polygon-rpc.com'
}
```

### IPFS Configuration
```typescript
// For production, use a reliable IPFS service
export const IPFS_CONFIG = {
  gateway: 'https://ipfs.io/ipfs/',
  apiUrl: 'https://ipfs.infura.io:5001/api/v0'
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test all pages:
# - http://localhost:3000 (Landing page)
# - http://localhost:3000/marketplace (Marketplace)
# - http://localhost:3000/connect (Wallet connection)
# - http://localhost:3000/verify (Campus verification)
# - http://localhost:3000/marketplace/list (List textbook)
```

### Smart Contract Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run contracts:test

# Run with coverage
npm run contracts:coverage

# Test specific contract
npx hardhat test test/CampusVerification.test.ts
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Test Web3 integration
npm run dev
# Then test wallet connection and contract interactions
```

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Smart Contract Events
Monitor these events for platform analytics:
- `StudentVerified` - New student verifications
- `ListingCreated` - New textbook listings
- `ListingSold` - Successful sales
- `PurchaseCompleted` - Completed transactions
- `RewardDistributed` - Token rewards

### Frontend Analytics
Consider integrating:
- Google Analytics
- Mixpanel
- Hotjar for user behavior
- Sentry for error tracking

## üîí Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- ‚úÖ Reentrancy protection implemented
- ‚úÖ Access control with Ownable pattern

- ‚úÖ Emergency withdrawal functions
- ‚úÖ Dispute resolution system

### Frontend Security
- ‚úÖ Environment variable protection
- ‚úÖ Input sanitization
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection
- ‚úÖ XSS prevention

### Production Security
